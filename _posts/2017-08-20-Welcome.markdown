This is an open source project advocating for better use consent in software design.

# What is consent?

Consent is most often discussed in terms of sex. "No means no" is a popular way to teach young people about inappropriate forms of sexual content.

However, we believe that consent is much more nuanced and goes beyond sex. Explicit, informed consent should be applied to every aspect of our daily lives.

## Explicit consent

Explicit consent is informed, enthusiastic confirmation in support of any action, from all parties involved. It's that simple!

## Implicit consent

Implicit consent is also known as "assumed" consent - this is when a person assumes that they have received another person's consent to interact with them or their data. This is where a lot of grey areas exist in software and in daily life.

Basically, if you're not sure you have someone's consent to do something - you should ask!

## Consensual software

Software that asks for your permission to interact with you or your data.
