# The Pledge

We believe that a user's explicit consent is a fundamental part of ethical software design and promise to advocate for our users in the software we write. We have read about [consent]() and the [actions we can take]() and, by signing our names here, hope to create a statement on record, to begin a conversation and to advocate for the people using the software we write by earning their consent and including them in the conversation.


Add your name by [opening a pull request](https://github.com/TheLucasMoore/consensual_software/pulls).

### Signed,

* [My Name](#) - Company Name (optional)
